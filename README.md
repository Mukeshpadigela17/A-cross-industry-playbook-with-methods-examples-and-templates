Problem-Solving Framework Automation

This project extracts problem statements from a PowerPoint presentation and generates a data-driven solution in Python. It demonstrates how to connect a generic problem-solving framework (like the one presented in the slides) with an actual machine learning workflow.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Extract Problem Statements
Reads .pptx slides and pulls out sentences that look like problem definitions.

Fallback Problem (Demo)
If no PowerPoint file is given, the script solves a sample problem:
"Predict and reduce appointment no-shows using data-driven interventions."

Machine Learning Pipeline

Generates synthetic data simulating patient appointments.

Builds a Logistic Regression model to predict no-shows.

Evaluates with ROC AUC, accuracy, precision, recall.

Intervention Strategy

Identifies high-risk patients (top 20%).

Recommends sending reminders only to those.

Estimates how much the no-show rate would be reduced.

Output Reports

Prints model performance.

Shows baseline vs. improved no-show rates.

Displays top 10 patient recommendations.

Saves extracted problem statements to extracted_problem_statements.csv.

ðŸš€ How to Run
1. With a PowerPoint file
python solve_problem_from_ppt.py Problem_Solving_Framework_Unique_160+.pptx


Extracts problem statements from slides.

Runs the predictive model (if relevant).

2. Without a PowerPoint file
python solve_problem_from_ppt.py


Skips extraction.

Runs the fallback problem: appointment no-shows.

ðŸ“Š Example Output
ROC AUC: 0.812, Accuracy: 0.752, Precision: 0.690, Recall: 0.601

Baseline no-show rate (test set): 0.178
No-show rate among top 20%: 0.391 (N=200)

If reminders cut no-shows by 40% for recipients:
Expected new no-show rate â‰ˆ 0.144
Absolute reduction â‰ˆ 0.034

Sample recommendations (top 10):
 age  lead_days  prev_no_shows  appointment_hour  weekday  distance_km  reminder_sent  socio_flag  pred_proba  reminder_recommendation recommendation_reason
